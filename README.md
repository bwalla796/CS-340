#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
#Modularity is the key to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable.  Keeping funcitons modular allows obsolete methods to be swapped out without sacraficing the entirity of the program.  This also allows the programmer to only focus on one part of the program and more easily identify errors in different functions.  The CRUD.py module can be used in any application that utilizes a mongo database.

#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
